# Multi-step-form

## What's this?

This is a solution to a [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/) challenge.

ItÂ´s a multi step form. Project was created without using figma or sketch version, so the design is purely based on pictures. It makes me understand Vue better.

The layout is fully responsive.
